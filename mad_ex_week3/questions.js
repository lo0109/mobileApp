 *              Mobile Application Development course. It includes a series of
 *              JavaScript challenges that focus array functions etc.
 *
 *              Students are expected to write their code solutions within this
 *              file in the designated sections for each exercise. The provided
 *              exercises are designed to enhance understanding of basic JavaScript
 *              syntax and problem-solving skills within the context of web and
 *              mobile app development.

 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * - Follow the prompts for each exercise and write your code in the specified
 *   areas.
 * - Run the provided tests after completing the exercises to check your work.
 * - Do not modify the structure of the file or the provided code snippets.
 * - Seek assistance if you encounter difficulty understanding the exercises or
 *   implementing the solutions.

/**
 * Exercise 1: Filters out negative numbers from an array.
 * @param {number[]} numbers - The array of numbers to filter.
 * @return {number[]} A new array containing only positive numbers.
 */
function filterNegativeNumbers(numbers) {
  // Your implementation here

/**
 * Exercise 2: Doubling Numbers Divisible by Three
 *
 * Objective:
 * Practice using array methods to identify and transform elements within an array.
 * This exercise focuses on processing numbers in an array to find those divisible by three
 * and then doubling those numbers.
 *
 * Task Description:
 * Write a function named `doubleDivisibleByThree`. This function takes an array of numbers as input,
 * filters out all numbers that are divisible by three, and returns a new array with those numbers doubled.
 *
 * @param {number[]} numbers - An array of numbers to be processed.
 * @return {number[]} A new array containing the numbers divisible by three doubled.

  // Your implementation here
  const newArr = numbers.filter(item => item%3==0).map(item=>item*2)
  return newArr

/**
 * Exercise 3: Selecting High-Performing Students with a Specific Hobby
 *
 * Objective:
 * Practice advanced array manipulation techniques involving filtering, mapping, and sorting.
 * This exercise focuses on processing an array of student objects based on GPA and hobbies,
 * then transforming the output.
 *
 * Task Description:
 * Write a function named `selectHighPerformingStudents`. This function takes an array of student objects as input.
 * Each student object has the following properties:
 * - id (integer): A unique identifier for the student.
 * - name (string): The student's name.
 * - email (string): The student's email.
 * - GPA (number): The student's GPA, ranging from 1 to 7.
 * - hobbies (array of strings): A list of the student's hobbies.
 *
 * The function should:
 * - Filter students who have a GPA greater than or equal to 5 and have 'coding' as one of their hobbies.
 * - Transform the filtered list to include only the student's name and email.
 * - Sort the resulting array alphabetically by the student's name.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} students - An array of student objects.
 * @return {Object[]} An array of objects containing the name and email of qualifying students, sorted by name.
 */
function selectHighPerformingStudents(students) {
  // Your implementation here
  const filteredStudents = students.filter(student => (student.GPA>=5 && (student.hobbies && student.hobbies.includes('coding')))).map(({ name, email }) => ({ name, email }));
  return filteredStudents.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
}

/**
 * Exercise 4: Aggregating Student Data with `reduce()`
 *
 * Objective:
 * Enhance your skills in using the `reduce()` method for complex data aggregation from an array of objects.
 * This exercise involves calculating statistics from a dataset of student objects, focusing on total count,
 * average GPA, and details about students interested in coding.
 *
 * Task Description:
 * Write a function named `aggregateStudentData` that processes an array of student objects. Each object includes
 * the following properties: `id` (integer), `name` (string), `email` (string), `GPA` (number, from 1 to 7),
 * and `hobbies` (array of strings).
 *
 * The function should return an object with these properties:
 * - `studentNum`: Total number of students
 * - `studentAvgGPA`: Average GPA of all students, rounded to two decimal places
 * - `codingStudentNum`: Number of students who list 'coding' as a hobby
 * - `codingStudentGPA`: Average GPA of students who list 'coding' as a hobby, rounded to two decimal places
 *
 * Implement this function using the `reduce()` method to aggregate the data effectively.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} students - An array of student objects.
 * @return {Object} An object containing aggregated student data.
 */
function aggregateStudentData(students) {
  // Your implementation here

  const studentAvgGPA = studentNum > 0? students.map(a=>a.GPA).reduce( (a,b)=> a+b,0)/studentNum : 0;
  const codingStudent = students.filter(student => (student.hobbies && student.hobbies.includes('coding')));
  const codingStudentNum = codingStudent.length;
  const codingStudentGPA = codingStudentNum>0? codingStudent.map(a=>a.GPA).reduce( (a,b)=> a+b,0)/codingStudentNum : 0;
  return {studentNum:studentNum, studentAvgGPA:+studentAvgGPA.toFixed(2), codingStudentNum:codingStudentNum, codingStudentGPA:+codingStudentGPA.toFixed(2)}

/**
 * Exercise 5: Swapping Between Sentence and CamelCase Forms
 * Objective:
 * Enhance your string manipulation skills in JavaScript by converting between sentence form and camelCase form.
 * This exercise will challenge you to implement a function that can detect the form of a given string and convert it to the other form.
 *
 * Task Description:
 * Write a function named `swapForm` that processes a string input. The function should behave as follows:
 * - If the input string is in sentence form (i.e., contains spaces), convert it to camelCase. For example,
 *   "open a bank account" should be converted to "openABankAccount".
 * - If the input string is a single word, assumed to be in camelCase, convert it back to a sentence in all lower cases.
 *   For example, "openABankAccount" would be converted to "open a bank account".
 *
 * Note: You may assume that sentence inputs will be all lower case and camelCase inputs will start with a lowercase letter followed by mixed case.
 *
 * @param {string} input - A string in either sentence form or camelCase form.
 * @return {string} The converted string, either in camelCase or sentence form.
 */
function swapForm(input) {
  // Your implementation here
  let output =''
  if (input.split(' ').length ==1) {
    const words = input.split(/(?=[A-Z])/);
    output = words.length == 1? words[0] : words.map(s=>s.toLowerCase()).join(' ');
  }
  else {
    const words = input.split(' ');
    // output = words[0]+words.slice(1).forEach(element => element.charAt(0).toUpperCase()+element.slice(1)).join('');
    output = words[0]+words.slice(1).map(element => element.charAt(0).toUpperCase()+element.slice(1)).join('');

  }
  // const words = input.length == 1 ? input.split(/(?=[A-Z])/).map(s => s.toLowerCase()): input.split(' ').map((c => c[0].toUpperCase()).join();
  return output
}

// Export the function for testing with Jest
